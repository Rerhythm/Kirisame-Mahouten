# Kirisame-Mahouten
This idea is from some existing courses sharing sites (both T&P). I think the students in the Department of Physics need a similar site maintained by SAST of Dept. Phys.  
Also I wish everyone could share knowledge, so on the site if you want to get some information about certain course, you need upload some materials (We don't require quantity). That's why I call it Kirisame Mahouten.  
# About this repository
Relative to Coding, I'm a green hand. This repository is to record my progress. So I decide to publicize it.
# Maintenance
Spread the site and Collect some materials.
